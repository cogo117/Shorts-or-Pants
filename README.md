# Shorts-or-Pants
Temperature App for Android Devices made in Visual Studio with the Xamarin Add-on.
The "Game" will attempt to access the thermometers in your phone and 
display an image for the user telling them whether to wear shorts or pants.
If your phone doesn't have a thermometer or can't access it the app will
use your phones gps to locate your position and use that to access a weather api
to download some weather data, in which is the temperature.
